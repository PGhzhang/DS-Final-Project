#### Author: Hanyu zhang &nbsp;  Yiyuan Feng
This is the final project for cs5304. In this project, we examine 3 different ways in building recommendation systems. 

- The first is to use matrix factorization based on user listening frequency, 
- The second method add user’s social network to improve the rating matrix we developed in first method. 
- The last one is add tag similarity to take the user taste into consideration and change the weight of different user’s rating in rating matrix. 

We find that social network have positive affect to our prediction in some degree. 
In the future, we will present a recommendation algorithm that adapts social influence into implicit feedback.
